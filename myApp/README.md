# MyApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Scully

Don't forget to run the `ng build` or `ng build --prod` before pre-rendering your HTML with Scully.

`npm run scully` will pre-render HTML pages.

`npm run scully -- --scanRoutes` will scan for available routes.

## API

I added a folder called `swapi` which contains the Star Wars API mentioned in the videos. To run that, you need to use Deno (https://deno.land). To start to server type in `deno run --allow-net app.ts` in your CLI.
